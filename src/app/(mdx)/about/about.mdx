# Welcome to recommen.do!

Recommen.do is an add-on meant to help you find products faster using AI.

It uses OpenAI's GPT to recommend a product from a search results list. Besides your input, AI's recommendation takes into account the product's description, price, rating and reviews.

We are aware that your time is very important, and choosing the best product for you can sometimes be a lengthy process. This is why we have developed a simple and intuitive interface that allows you to get a product recommendation in just a few seconds. Our platform is user-friendly, so anyone can access our services. We are dedicated to constantly improving our website and extension.
